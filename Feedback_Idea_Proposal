Highlight what makes this project unique compared to existing studies using deep learning for brain tumor detection. For example, emphasize real-time performance, scalability, or integration with clinical workflows.
Consider incorporating multi-modal imaging (combining MRI, CT, and PET scans) to improve diagnostic accuracy and address scenarios where single-modality imaging falls short.

Overall, it is well structured and unique idea. I like it. Thank you :)
